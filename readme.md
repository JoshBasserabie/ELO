Currently chess players' ratings are calculated using the Elo rating system. The change in rating each game does not factor in whether the player had the white or black pieces. This project aims to calculate two separate Elo ratings for each player, one for when they play as white and one for when they play as black. This will show how much a player's rating is affected by playing with the white or black pieces, will allow comparison of different players' strengths even when they are playing with different colour pieces (including when they are playing against each other) and show the overall gap in strength that players have when playing with the white pieces compared to the black pieces.
